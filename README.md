## NLP-Powered Resume Parser and Job Recommendation Engine
This project focuses on automating the process of parsing resumes and matching candidate profiles with relevant job openings, optimizing recruitment by using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning.

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
The NLP-Powered Resume Parser and Job Recommendation Engine is designed to streamline recruitment by automatically analyzing resumes and recommending jobs that match candidate skills and experience. Traditional resume screening is time-consuming and often lacks precision in matching specific skills to job roles. This project uses advanced NLP techniques to extract and interpret key resume data, generating personalized job recommendations based on the parsed information. The system combines a user-friendly interface with a robust backend, aiming to improve candidate-job matching efficiency.

## Features
<!--List the features of the project as shown below-->
- NLP Resume Parsing: Utilizes spaCy for accurate information extraction, capturing key data like skills, experience, and education.
- Job Recommendation Engine: Matches candidate profiles to relevant job roles by using machine learning algorithms.
- Interactive Interface: Enables candidates to upload resumes and instantly view suitable job matches.
- Scalability: Capable of processing large datasets of resumes and job descriptions efficiently.
- Real-Time Updates: Offers dynamic job recommendations as new openings are added to the system.

## Requirements
<!--List the requirements of the project as shown below-->
* Operating System: Compatible with Windows 10/11 or Ubuntu 18.04+ (64-bit recommended).
* Programming Language: Python 3.8 or higher for NLP processing and backend development.
* Development Framework: Flask for backend services, enabling rapid deployment of the recommendation engine.
* NLP Library: spaCy for efficient resume parsing and information extraction.
* Machine Learning Libraries: scikit-learn for implementing recommendation algorithms.
* Database: MongoDB or SQL for storing parsed resume data and job listings.
* Version Control: Git for collaborative development and project management.
* IDE: VS Code for development, debugging, and integration with Git.
